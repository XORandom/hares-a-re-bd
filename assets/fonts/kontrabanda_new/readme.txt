Font Kontrabanda is designed by Anastasia Vinokurova, to reflect the idea project - https://kontrabanda.cc/ - creative video agency. 

In the beginning there were only two alphabets Russian and English, but after a while the font became popular and there were requests to extend it to German, Czech and Slavic languages and it was modernized.

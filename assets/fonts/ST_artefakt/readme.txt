The font was restored from an old book cover from the 60s, made with deliberate distortions, as if from a bad old print. I really wanted it not to sink into oblivion along with its paper carrier.

Stylistically, this is a late version of Russian Art Deco, which turned into a Soviet architectural accident. In the 60s, it was not yet its final form (which happened in the 70s and is imprinted on a huge number of monuments and buildings of the USSR), but a transitional one, in which the excesses of forms are preserved from the bourgeois ancestor. I did not go overboard with the excesses, it was important to preserve both the strictness of the set and humanity. I did not lick the kerning for the same reason - I removed the main holes in the set, leaving the secondary ones.

Purpose - works in a purely historical context. It will be useful for the design of books, toys, covers. Commercial potential - questionable. Therefore - 100% free, for all types of tasks (don't ask "is it possible?" It is possible. It is possible for everything and without permission).

Package includes: letters, numbers, very basic punctuation, several special characters.

Extended Latin and Cyrillic.
